# TB Surveillance Dashboard - Rwanda

A comprehensive Tuberculosis surveillance dashboard for monitoring TB cases and treatment outcomes in Rwanda.

## Features

- 📈 **Key Performance Indicators**: Track total cured cases, LTBI coverage, and yearly TB incidence
- 🎯 **Treatment Outcomes**: Monitor cured vs other treatment outcomes with time series analysis
- ⚠️ **High-Risk Groups**: Analyze TB trends in high-risk populations (prisoners, HIV+, contacts, elderly, children, diabetics, mining workers, refugees)
- 📋 **TB Notifications**: Track new TB cases and relapse incidents with incidence rates per 100,000 population
- 👶 **Pediatric Analysis**: Monitor LTBI treatment coverage for contacts under 5 years and TB cases in children under 14

## Data Source

The dashboard uses TB surveillance data from Rwanda's health system (2023-2024), including:
- Patient demographics and enrollment dates
- Treatment outcomes and histories
- High-risk group classifications
- Contact tracing information
- LTBI treatment data

## Key Metrics

### Targets
- **LTBI Coverage**: >90% of eligible children under 5
- **TB Incidence**: ≤46 per 100,000 population

### Calculated Metrics
- Total cured cases (with option for cured+completed)
- LTBI coverage percentage for contacts under 5 years
- Yearly normalized TB incidence per 100,000 population
- High-risk group distribution
- Pediatric TB case analysis

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud
